# React Kite Shop

## Overview

It's a project of a fictional online kitesurfing shop. Among the others, this application contains the functionality of sorting, filtering, searching, and adding products to the cart. Itâ€™s based on Context Api and Contentful Api. It is styled using Styled-Components and Material-UI. Thanks to this project, I immersed myself in React and learned styled-components.
